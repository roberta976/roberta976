## Sobre mim

I'm 20y, I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at IFPE- Instituto Federal de Pernambuco.
I'm always curious to learn more about new technologies and how they can work in different projects. I'm passionate about the Front End area, but I also develop some automation projects with Python. I also really like creating interfaces in Figma before coding.

## Technologies and skills

* Front-End : HTML, CSS e JavaScript
* Java for small projects
* Spring for Web Applications
* Mobile programming with React Native
* Webdriver with Selenium and Python
* Study on UI/UX Design
* I create interfaces in Figma
* React.js
* PHP
* SQL
